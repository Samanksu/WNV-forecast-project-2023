team_model_designation: primary
methods: A temporal fusion transformer was trained for each state to make 9 month ahead quantile predictions. Several models were trained and tested, the final results include the best model for each state.
ensemble_of_hub_models: false
data_inputs: Various NOAA monthly weather data is used(average temperature, max temperature, min temperature, precipitation, z-index etc.) per state. Also, the month is encoded into the model cycically.
The model also uses the supplied arbovirus data, locally. The model incorporates this data by using the min/max/average of the infection rate and rate/trap for all collected counties within 500 miles.
