## Mosquito Data

Participants may use [mosquito abundance and infection data](https://github.com/vectorsurv/cdc-forecasting-challenge/tree/main/2023-wnv) compiled by [VectorSurv](https://vectorsurv.org/) to supplement their forecast models. Updated current season data will be released on the 15th of each month beginning April 15th, 2023. Initial data files will be available on April 1st, 2023, including historical data for prior years where available.

Please note that the data available are not exhaustive. Data are provided through partnerships with local vector control and public health agencies using VectorSurv. The agencies represented in the provided data have opted to provide their surveillance data to inform model predictions; these agencies represent a subset of jurisdictions from some U.S. states (see list below). Note that differences in available mosquito data may exist between agencies (e.g., time period of available historical data, trap types, species categories) and not all states collect mosquito data. Data may also change as the year progresses (e.g., due to edits or additions of historical data). Therefore, new versions of the data will be posted on each release date.

### [Mosquito Abundance Data](https://github.com/vectorsurv/cdc-forecasting-challenge/tree/main/2023-wnv/abundance)
This dataset includes monthly adult trapping data for *Culex tarsalis*, *Culex pipiens* complex (*Culex pipiens*, *Culex quinquefasciatus*, and their hybrids), *Culex restuans*, *Culex stigmatosoma*, *Culex salinarius*, and *Culex nigripalpus*) by county, trap type, and species. This includes data on the total trapping effort (number of sites, trap nights, and collections) and the collections of each species (number of adults collected and number of collections in which the species was detected).

### [Mosquito Infection Data](https://github.com/vectorsurv/cdc-forecasting-challenge/tree/main/2023-wnv/infection)
This dataset includes monthly testing of adult female mosquitoes for West Nile virus by county and trap type. Mosquitoes are commonly tested in pools (i.e., batches) of 1-50 mosquitoes per pool. These data include information on the total testing volume (number of pools tested and number of mosquitoes tested) and the results of testing for West Nile virus (number of pools positive for West Nile virus).
